                     lhs2TeX version 1.11
                     ====================

We are pleased to announce a new release of lhs2TeX, 
a preprocessor to generate LaTeX code from literate Haskell
sources.

lhs2TeX includes the following features:

* Highly customized output.

* Liberal parser -- no restriction to Haskell 98.

* Generate multiple versions of a program or document from 
  a single source.

* Active documents: call Haskell to generate parts of the 
  document (useful for papers on Haskell).

* A manual explaining all the important aspects of lhs2TeX.

Changes (w.r.t. lhs2TeX 1.9)
----------------------------

[Note that 1.10 has never been released to avoid confusion
with some privately distributed versions.] 

* Specification code is now handled correctly (that is, ignored) 
  in the "code" and "newcode" styles.

* Comments and Pragmas are handled in a better way by 
  the "newcode" style.

* There are some new forms of implicit formatting directives.

* The LaTeX code produced in the poly style looks slightly
  more beautiful.

* There is a new Library section, containing some frequently
  used formatting directives.

* Generation of file/linenumber directives in the produced
  LaTeX code, for Stefan Wehr's "adjust" tool. Based on a
  patch submitted by Stefan Wehr.

* lhs2TeX can now replace ghc's literate preprocessor.

* Improved efficiency of \eval and \perform (to call ghci
  or hugs from lhs2TeX documents).

Requirements and Download
-------------------------

A source distribution that should be suitable for Unix-based
environments is available from

  http://www.cs.uu.nl/~andres/lhs2tex/

It has been verified to build on Linux and MacOSX.
For some platforms, binaries are available.

You need a recent version of GHC (6.X is tested) to build 
lhs2TeX, and, of course, you need a TeX distribution 
to make use of lhs2TeX's output. The program includes a 
configuration that is suitable for use with LaTeX. In theory, 
there should be no problem to generate code for other TeX 
flavors, such as plainTeX or ConTeXt.


  Happy lhs2TeXing,
