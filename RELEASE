                     lhs2TeX version 1.5
                     ===================

We are pleased to announce the first official release of
lhs2TeX, a preprocessor to generate LaTeX code from literate
Haskell sources.

lhs2TeX includes the following features:

* different modes to process your source file: for instance,
  "tt" mode uses non-proportional fonts for the code examples
  while still allowing you to highlight keywords etc, whereas
  "math" mode uses proportional fonts for identifiers, handles
  indentation nicely, and replaces binary operators by
  mathematical symbols.

* formatting directives which let you customize the way certain
  tokens in the source code should appear in the processed 
  output

* a liberal parser that can handle most of the language 
  extensions; you don't restrict yourself to Haskell 98 by
  using lhs2TeX

* preprocessor-style conditionals that allow you to generate
  different versions of a document from a single source file
  (for instance, a paper and a presentation).

Changes
-------

Although development on lhs2TeX has begun as early as 1997,
it has never been formally released before. This is a first
release that should be mostly compatible to versions that
have been inofficially distributed so far. It should compile
with the latest GHC versions. 

The purpose of this release is also to set a stable base
for future development which has already started: a yet
undocumented new "poly" mode is being designed to replace
"math" mode in the long term. With "poly" mode, one can build
complex layouts in code blocks with multiple alignments.

Requirements and Download
-------------------------

A source distribution that should be suitable for Unix-based
environments is available from

  http://www.informatik.uni-bonn.de/~ralf/software.html#lhs2TeX

It has been verified to build on Linux and MacOSX.

You need a recent version of GHC (5.04.X or 6.0) to build
lhs2TeX, and, of course, you need a TeX distribution to make
use of lhs2TeX's output. The program includes a configuration
that is suitable for use with LaTeX. In theory, there should
be no problem to generate code for other TeX flavors, such as
plainTeX or ConTeXt.


  Happy lhs2TeXing,
