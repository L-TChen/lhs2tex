                     lhs2TeX version 1.14
                     ====================

We are pleased to announce a new release of lhs2TeX, 
a preprocessor to generate LaTeX code from literate Haskell
sources.

lhs2TeX includes the following features:

* Highly customized output.

* Liberal parser -- no restriction to Haskell 98.

* Generate multiple versions of a program or document from 
  a single source.

* Active documents: call Haskell to generate parts of the 
  document (useful for papers on Haskell).

* A manual explaining all the important aspects of lhs2TeX.

Changes (w.r.t. lhs2TeX 1.12)
-----------------------------

* Compatible with cabal-1.6; traditional configure/make
  installation should still work.

* Unicode support.

* Support for Agda's lexing rules (via --agda flag).

Requirements and Download
-------------------------

A source distribution is available from

  http://people.cs.uu.nl/andres/lhs2tex/

Should work on all major platforms, but has mainly been
tested on Linux. Binaries will be made available on request.

You need a recent version of GHC (6.8.2 is tested, older versions
might work) to build lhs2TeX, and, of course, you need a TeX
distribution to make use of lhs2TeX's output. The program includes
a configuration that is suitable for use with LaTeX. In theory, 
there should be no problem to generate code for other TeX 
flavors, such as plainTeX or ConTeXt.


  Happy lhs2TeXing,
