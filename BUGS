Known bugs or problems
======================

*  opening %{ parenthesis without closing %} 
   causes (Fail: Main.lhs:186: Non-exhaustive patterns in lambda)
   [ I think this is fixed. ]

*  document command line options more systematically
   - for instance, document --path=:bla and --path=bla:

*  add @@ and || quoting with typical errors as FAQ

*  operator sections involving `infix` operators don't render nicely

*  "default" style, i.e. if no style is selected, seems to be --tt;
   this isn't a good choice -- should there be a default style at all?

*  in --tt mode, the <- is formatted as the \in-symbol of the tt
   symbol font, where the \leftarrow would seem more appropriate;
   maybe the default should be changed to \char''30 for <-, but
   compatibility is also worth a thing.

*  the manual does not explain how ' is treated in TeX strings, such
   as occur in formatting statements.

*  the manual and most of all INSTALL should mention the texmf-tree
   location procedure and the --with-texmf as well as the
   --disable-polytable flag ...

*  there is some bad interaction between parametrized formatting
   directives and directly connecting alignment columns; an example
   is in Experiments/FormatAlign.lhs.

*  there are hardcoded maximum sizes in TeX parser for commands and
   environments; this should at least be mentioned, better be made
   configurable, best be removed somehow

*  improperly nested parentheses can still lead to non-displayed code
