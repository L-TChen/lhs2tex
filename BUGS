Known bugs or problems
======================

*  opening %{ parenthesis without closing %} 
   causes (Fail: Main.lhs:186: Non-exhaustive patterns in lambda)
   [ I think this is fixed. ]

*  document command line options more systematically
   - for instance, document --path=:bla and --path=bla:

*  add @@ and || quoting with typical errors as FAQ

*  operator sections involving `infix` operators don't render nicely
